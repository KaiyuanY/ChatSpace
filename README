//I was planning to build a 1 to 1 real time chat app, with contact list and chat list, but did not have enough time to do so. So in the app bundle there are some irrelevant view controller classes. Just ignore them, I am going to continue building on top of this. The relevant classes for this project are AppDelegate, LoginViewController, and ChatViewController
